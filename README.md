Calibration of Multimodal 3D Structured-Light Systems Using Digital Features

Introduction

These are some basic instructions for using the code. If you run testFM.m you'll basically get a comparison of different focus measures. computeFV.m computes all focus measures on the specified data set. The folder FocusMeasures contains all implemented focus measures including ours anisoFM.m.
Focus measures:

    S1: Moscaritolo et al.
    S2: l2-norm image gradient
    S3: Energy of Laplacian
    S4: Summed-modified Laplacian (Nayer and Nakagawa)
    S5: Frequency-selective weighted median filter (Choi and Lee)
    Sa: Anisotropy-based focus measure (Marrugo et al.)
